Augmented Reality and Blockchain

TARGET PROBLEM

Squat the world, augment it, make it accessible, make it "smart", create communities, communicate and transact via map.

INVOLVED TECH

Ethereum + ENS + Status + Aragon = Unstoppable Augmented Reality!

DESCRIPTION

Step 1: SQUAT THE WORLD

Imagine the world, imagine to split it with a grid into plots.
Each plot refers to a standard coordinates set defined by the grid resolution.
Example plot coordinates: 44°32'7.6"N 11°32'1.64"E

We all love the ENS and the way you squat domain names (domain names are strings).

Now let's transform a plot coordinates into a string:

44°32'7.6"N11°32'1.64"E ---> 0443207N0113201E

We are now ready to exploit the ENS ledger as official squatting layer for the world!

0443207N0113201E ---> 0443207n0113201e.eth

This will incentivate the use of ENS, and ENS will grant unique ownership (and all the squatting tech needed!)

Step 2: AUGMENTING THE WORLD WITH STATUS

Whenever you click on a plot, by referring to the coordinates you can open the related Status channel.

Example https://get.status.im/chat/public/44°32'7.6"N11°32'1.64"E

This grid/squatting strategy allows to transform Status into a geography based chatting system.

Use cases:

A) You want to contact the owner of a plot, you click on the map, you open the related staus channel and you make a deal chatting in real time.

B) You are a journalist, there is an earthquake on the other side of the world, you reach it via map, and you can interact with the locals via Status.

C) You walk around the world, and you can talk with all people in that plot in real time.


Step 3: MAKE THE WORLD "SMART"

Once you squat a plot you can apply a smart contract to the related ENS record.

This opens infinte possibilities.

Use cases:

A) Ask money to third party for publishing in your plot (text, links, feeds, 3D object, dapps...) 

B) Ask money for adding virtual layers

C) Split the plot into subplots and sell/rent-out the parcels

By default the business will be made with DAI, squatters can decide to use custom tokens.

Step 4: CREATE COMMUNITIES

Once you own a plot you can tokenize it!

Use cases: 

A) tokenize the plot and make it ruled by a DAO via the newly created token

B) create an utility token to rule activities inside the plot, may they be real activities or virtual

FURTHER TRICKS

Use Status extensions to facilitate deals and interaction between users/travellers and plot owners.
